Alrighty folx, 

from now on the bot is in it's final(?) form!

I've tweaked the palette generation parameters for a little more consistency and variety, & am now able to run it on my computer instead of using rss and janky third party stuff. 
And best of all, Alt text should be automatically applied! Yay!

I'm sure the code's a mess - I'm still learning and all, but this was a ton of fun.

If you notice any weirdness, or have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out!

Thanks! & Enjoy!
